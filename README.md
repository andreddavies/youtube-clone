I created this project with ReactJS and Redux. I'm new with Redux, so I use it to learn more about the technology and improve my knowledge.

This is a Youtube clone that search videos on origin (Youtube) about term on the input. I used an Google API that return the results.

Also, you can watch the video on the main component.
